## Memory Maze Game

Based on the Codewars Kata [Maze Runner](https://www.codewars.com/kata/58663693b359c4a6560001d6) and the code I had written to solve the kata, I built a single page front end app which tests the users memory by showing a maze for 4 seconds and then asking for the directions to escape.

On this project, I wanted to practise my JavaScript DOM, HTML and CSS. I tested the Javascript in Jest. The app is hosted on Heroku and uses Express for the server.

#### Issues to fix

[] Won't let you press escape or an alert comes up if you press enter without entering anything
[] direction input doesn't have to be in capitals
[] invalid characters/non nsew letters to have an alert?
[] Test the front end

Additional User Stories to be implemented

```

#### What I learnt

- more CSS including animation
- strengthened DOM skills, through timeouts, creating elements
